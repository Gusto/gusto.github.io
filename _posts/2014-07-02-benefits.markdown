# Benefits

The benefit object in Gusto contains high level information about a particular benefit type and its tax considerations. When companies choose to offer a benefit, they are creating a <a href="/v1/company_benefits">Company Benefit</a> object associated with a particular benefit.

#### Note for S-Corporations
An update to Gusto's payroll engine in October, 2017, has pushed the responsibility of understanding how benefits should be taxed for 2% shareholders of S-Corporations onto the engine itself. Previously, Payroll Administrators had to associate 2% shareholders with `posttax` medical, dental, and vision benefits in order to tax those employees correctly (2% shareholders are not eligible for pre-tax deductions, and contributions are treated as imputed wages). That is no longer the case.

Now, S-Corp Payroll Administrators should associate all 2% shareholders to `pretax` medical, dental, and vision benefits through our [Employee Benefits API](/v1/employee_benefits). When payroll runs, Gusto will automatically determine whether to treat the benefit as `pretax` or `posttax` based an employee's 2% shareholder status.
