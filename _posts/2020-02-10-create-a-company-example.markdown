# Creating a Company

## Overview

The company provisioning API provides a way to create a Gusto company as part of your integration. When you successfully call the API, the API does the following:

* Creates a new company in Gusto.
* Creates a new user in Gusto.
* Makes the new user the primary payroll administrator of the new company.
* Sends a welcome email to the new user.

In the response, you will receive an account claim URL. Redirect the user to this URL to complete their account setup inside of Gusto.

## Authentication

Due to the nature of this endpoint, Gusto will provide partners with an API token and will permit partners to use API Token Authentication instead of OAuth to provision Gusto accounts. The API token is included in the authorization HTTP header with the Token scheme, e.g.:

```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Token bbb286ff1a4fe6b84742b0d49b8d0d65bd0208d27d3d50333591df71
```
