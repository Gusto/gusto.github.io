# Accounts

The accounts API is for creating accounts for new customers on Gusto. With
a minimum amount of information, partners may create a user, company, and the
related permissions to go from setup onboarding information.

**Note** This endpoint requires authorization via [Token Authentication](/v1/examples/authentication#api-token-authentication) with an API token. Normal OAuth credentials will _not_ allow
account creation.
