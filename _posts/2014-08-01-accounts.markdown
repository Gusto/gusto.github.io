# Accounts

The accounts API is for creating accounts for new customers on Gusto. With
a minimum amount of information, partners may create a user, company, and the
related permissions to go from setup onboarding information.

**Note** This endpoint requires authorization via [Token Authentication](/v1/examples/authentication#api-token-authentication) with an API token. Normal OAuth credentials will _not_ allow
account creation.

#### Collision Handling

A collision happens when:
a) A company with the same Federal EIN already exists in Gusto.
b) A company with the same name and same payroll admin email address already exists in Gusto.

If the partner provisioned both of the companies that are colliding, then a `409 (Conflict)` response will be returned.  If the partner did not provision the colliding company, then a new company will be created and a `201 (Created)` response will be returned.  If the collision is due to a duplicate EIN, the new company will be created with a blank EIN.  This will engage the small biz team at Gusto to resolve the colliding companies while allowing a normal provisioning flow to continue.
